# Layer 4: Ready Meals & Meal Kits

**Final attested components and flexible assemblies - verifiable trust that scales**

## The Implementation Breakthrough

**The key insight**: Ready Meals and Meal Kits should look like the same thing to users - both are closed, attested components that can be trusted and reused. The difference is scope and customization, not trustworthiness.

**This solves the "speed vs. security" dilemma by making both approaches verifiably secure.**

## Ready Meals (`/ready-meals/`)
